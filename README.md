# taktak
*another boring way to take notes*

this project was made using:
- pywebview
- vite js + reactjs

#### Development
it is recommended that you have both `uv` and `volta` installed in your machine so that the project can be run in the correct versions

```bash
# In the root project
pnpm run setup
pnpm run dev
```

Then you can just use the other scripts to either build or to manage both the front and back

#### TODO
- docker container for creating both windows and linux binaries
