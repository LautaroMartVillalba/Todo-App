# taktak
*another boring way to take notes*

this project was made using:
- pywebview
- vite js + reactjs

#### Development
it is recommended that you have both `uv` and `node` installed in your machine.

**install packages**
```bash
# Inside the folder
uv sync

cd ../frontend
pnpm i
```

Then you can normally use pnpm for running the project

```bash
pnpm

```
